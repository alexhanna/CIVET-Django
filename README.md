# CIVET-Django

This is the documentation for a prototype of the CIVET---Contentious Incident Variable Entry Template---customizable data entry system running in the Django web framework. CIVET is being developed by the NSF-sponsored project titled ``A Method for Leveraging Public Information Sources for Social Science Research'' which is creating tools to improve the efficiency of data generation in the social sciences. The project has an initial focus on coding event data in the domain of contentious politics, but we expect that these tools will be relevant in a number of data-generation domains.

The file *CIVET.Documentation.pdf* provides information on installing and operating the system. We expect to have a fully operational version available by the end of August 2015.
